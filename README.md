# 🚁 Autonomous UAV – Intelligent Drone Navigation and Landing System

This project showcases an autonomous UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) designed to fly without human input, scan its environment using a depth camera, detect safe landing zones through onboard processing, and autonomously land. The system is built using ROS and tested in a simulated 3D environment using Gazebo.

## 🔍 Overview

The UAV is equipped with:

- **Autonomous flight capabilities** using ROS.
- **Depth camera** for real-time mapping and environment perception.
- **Machine learning-based safe zone detection** to identify suitable landing spots.
- **Gazebo simulation environment** for development and testing.

## ✨ Features

- 🚀 **Autonomous Navigation**: Path planning and flight control in dynamic environments.
- 🧠 **Intelligent Perception**: Scene understanding using depth data and computer vision.
- 📦 **ROS-based Architecture**: Modular nodes for flight, perception, and decision-making.
- 🧪 **Simulation Support**: Fully integrated with Gazebo for safe and repeatable testing.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **ROS** (Robot Operating System)
- **Gazebo** (for simulation)
- **Depth Cameras** (simulated using Gazebo plugins)
- **OpenCV** & **PCL** (Point Cloud Library)
- **Python / C++**
- **Custom ML Models** for terrain classification
